      <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
      <p>
        In this page you can read about where you may have seen manatees before!

      <h2>Manatee habitat facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids.</li>
        <li>
          The famous explorer and scientist Jacques Cousteau actually made a film
          about manatees, title ‘the forgotten mermaids’!
        </li>
        <li>
          In the olden days a very famous book about whales called Moby Dick was
          written. Sadly manatees were not the star of the show, however the author
          did describe them!
        </li>
        <li>
          In the movie 51st state Samuel L Jackson befriended a manatee called
          Chris.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sadly no manatees appeared in the film 50 first dates, however there were
          vomiting walruses which can sometimes be mistaken for manatees.
